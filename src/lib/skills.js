// 🐝 Hivey Skills, Goals & Enhance — "technologies" that make ANY OpenRouter model more
// capable than it is on its own. They are surfaced as slash-commands ("/") in the composer
// and work with every provider/model, because they're pure prompt engineering applied client
// side (no provider-specific API needed).

// Expert skills: each one turns the selected model into a domain specialist (a focused system
// prompt + working method). Activate with `/skill` → pick one; it stays active (chip) until
// cleared. Kept tight so they steer without bloating the context.
